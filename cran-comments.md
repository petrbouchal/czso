## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

No WARNINGs or consistently occurring NOTEs were issued by any of the systems I used to check tha package:
- Github-based checks: macos-latest-release; ubuntu-latest devel, release and oldrel-1, and windows-latest release
- local MacOS (M1) Monterey 15.6.1 beta

* this is a pro forma update to have the package reinstated - the error shown earlier in CRAN checks was resolved by the API provider fixing a network issue; there were no errors in the last 5 or so days before the package was removed.
