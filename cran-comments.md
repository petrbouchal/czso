## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

No WARNINGs or consistently occurring NOTEs were issued by any of the systems I used to check tha package:
- r-hub
- win-builder devel and release
- local MacOS (M1) Monterey 12.3 beta

* this is a quick patch to fix a CRAN check failure regarding validity of HTML documentation
